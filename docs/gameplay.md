This is a simple memory game where you have to find pairs of cards. The player can choose between 4x4, 6x6, or 8x8 respectively, is played on a 8x8 grid.

The cards are shuffled and placed face down on the grid. The player can flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they are removed from the grid. If they don't match, they are flipped back face down. The game ends when all pairs are found.

## Game modes

The game has a single-player mode and a multi-player mode.

### Single-player mode

In the single-player mode, the player has to find all pairs in the shortest time possible.

### Multi-player mode

In the multi-player mode, two players take turns to find pairs. The player with the most pairs wins.

## Basic gameplay

A new game is initialized by one player who chooses grid size and game mode.

A player can invite another player to join the game by link. By clicking the link, the invited player will be shown a page with all set game details (e.g. grid size, player who sent them the invitation) on which they can either accept or decline the invitation.

When a player accepts the invitation, they are redirected to the game page, where they can see the game board.

The user who send the invitation will be notified if the invited player accepted or declined the invitation by push notification.

All players must be present to be able to start the game. The player who clicks the start button first starts the game and has the first draw.
