# Game of Cards

This is a playground for creating a card game in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Local dev setup

The `.vscode` folder has to be commited as well, otherwise, the liveview service does not run reliably on port 5502.  
Remember to enable `third party cookies` for localhost to have the appwrite auth work.  

## Prod deployment

Create a config to work with the deployment URL to have the deployed webpage work with appwrite ðŸ« .
