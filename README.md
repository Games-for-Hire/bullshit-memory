# Bullshit Memory

This is a playground for creating a memory game in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Local dev setup

The `.vscode` folder has to be committed as well, otherwise, the Live Server service does not run reliably on port 5502.
Remember to enable third-party `cookies` for localhost, or 127.0.0.1 respectively, to allow the Appwrite service to work properly.

## Prod deployment

Create a config to work with the deployment URL to have the deployed webpage work with appwrite ðŸ« .
